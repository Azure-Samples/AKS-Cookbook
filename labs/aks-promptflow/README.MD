![visual](visual.png)

Playground to try the [Azure AI Studio Prompt Flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/prompt-flow) with AKS.  
Prompt flow is a development tool designed to streamline the entire development cycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Prompt flow provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies the process of prototyping, experimenting, iterating, and deploying your AI applications.  
Prompt flow is available independently as an open-source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow).

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8 or later version](https://www.python.org/) installed.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with the [Jupyter notebook extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) enabled.
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed.
- [An Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with Contributor permissions. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=azurefreeaccount) before you begin.
- [Sign in to Azure with Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli-interactively) and select the Azure Subscription that you want to use in this lab.
- [Install kubectl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-install-cli), the Kubernetes command-line tool.

### üöÄ Get started

Proceed by opening the [Jupyter notebook](aks-promptflow.ipynb), and follow the steps provided.

### üóëÔ∏è Clean up resources

When you're finished with the lab, you should remove all your deployed resources from Azure to avoid extra charges and keep your Azure subscription uncluttered.
Use the [clean-up-resources notebook](clean-up-resources.ipynb) for that.
